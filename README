kazukishida's first ever Git repo!


=== Log ===

-- June 29 2012
This is my first Git repository, pushed successfully to GitHub. 
Added a rudimentary hello.c file, then updated it by committing 
on my local machine, and pushing it to GitHub once more.

This is exciting! I wish I knew about this useful tool while
we were making our MP on CS 150.
